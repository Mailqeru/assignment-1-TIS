## My Reflection  
The event was all about new ways of teaching and learning. The theme was kind of serious, talking about making resilient graduates, but it turned out to be a fun tech fest. 
I saw this poster about making STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) cool in schools. They talked about Problem-Based Learning, mentoring and competitions. Then, ArchVision VR was like stepping into the future. This is about learning building using Virtual Reality. AI was there too, making learning personalized. This is all about computer that can help you all the time. It's like having a smart buddy for studying. The best part was talking to the people behind these projects. They explained how ideas come out, the problem they faced, and many more. It made tech stuff less confusing.  

## Feeback/Suggestion  
I think that they should make sessions for students where they have free time. This is because not all students have the same time to go there. Next, if everyone goes at once, it will also be full of people. To make an interview session is also difficult and also to see all the posters on display.
